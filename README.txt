Note: EZE is built on KIVY and so, you must install KIVY first by using the 
following commands on your code editor/IDE; ‘pip install kivy’, once done with
 installing KIVY, you are free to install EZE

Getting Started:
1. Install EZE using pip: `pip install eze`
2. Import EZE in your Python script: `from eze.app import EZEApp`
3. Start building your application with EZE's intuitive API

Acknowledgments:
I would like to express my gratitude to the KivyMD team for creating 
such an amazing library. 
Their work on KivyMD not only inspired me but also laid the foundation 
for my own project, EZE. 
By building upon KivyMD's UI/UX capabilities, I was able to create a library
 that advances and enhances the user experience.

Special thanks to all the developers who have contributed to KivyMD, your 
dedication and hard work have enabled the creation of countless projects like mine.

I'd also like to thank the entire Kivy community for their support and resources. 
Your collective efforts have made it possible for developers like me to build innovative applications.

I would like to specially thank (KivyMD, FreeCodeCamp, Tech with Tim, Eric Sandberg, 
Nicholas Renotte, Eric Sandberg, Derek Banas, Sentdex), for their innovative and inspirational 
tutorials on YouTube. You all one way or the other contributed to this great project. Thanks
